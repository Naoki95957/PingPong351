# Repository for assignment 3 in computer architecture
## Team:
 - Andre
 - Goldi
 - Naoki (me)
### Setup
 - We will be primarily working on ATMEGA328P since this is an UNO R3 project
   - If in the event that we need more memory, we should uniformly decide on a new controller
   - Any variation of this chip should be okay: DIP, QFN, etc
 - There is a posibility that I'll attempt to use an extra ESP32 to enable WIFI - scoring
   - Basically the score and buttons will be avalible on web as well as physically
